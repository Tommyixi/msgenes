    		<p class='small-font'>Dr. Hauser is a graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Harvard Medical School. He trained in internal medicine at the New York Hospital/Cornell Medical Center and in neurology at the Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School. Following postdoctoral fellowships in immunology at Harvard Medical School and the Pasteur Institute in Paris, France, he joined the faculty at Harvard and established an independent laboratory at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Since 1992, he has served as chairman and Robert A. Fishman Distinguished Professor of the Department of Neurology at UCSF. Dr. Hauser’s research has focused on MS immunology and genetics. He was responsible for one of the first clinical trials of immunosuppression on the course of progressive MS. His early work identified the CD4 T-cell as important in MS and also in experimental models of demyelination. His laboratory also played a central role in elucidating the role of pathogenic autoantibodies in demyelination, culminating in a clinical trial showing the benefit of Rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that selectively targets and depletes CD20+ B lymphocytes. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Association of Physicians, a member of the Institute of Medicine and serves as an editor of the medical textbook Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine and Chief Editor of the Annals of Neurology.</p>

    		<p class='small-font'>Dr. Baranzini has over 15 years of experience working in human genetics projects. A graduate from the University of Buenos Aires, Argentina, his is initial research focused on genotype-phenotype correlations in Mendelian disorders. Since 1997 Dr. Baranzini has been involved in gene expression analysis and his current research focuses on characterizing the molecular mechanisms of homeostasis and disease in the context of human and experimental demyelination. To this end, he uses a combination of “wet lab” methods including DNA microarrays, proteomics, and laser capture microdissection, in combination with “dry lab” analytical approaches encompassing bioinformatics, complexity theory, and mathematical modeling. website: <a href="https://www.baranzinilab.ucsf.edu">baranzinilab.ucsf.edu</a></p>
